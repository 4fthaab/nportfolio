                Hello! Iâ€™m Afthab Rahman, a passionate and motivated Computer Science Engineering student with a
                strong interest in software development, machine learning, and data science. My journey in the
                tech world started with a curiosity about how things work, leading me to explore programming,
                algorithms, and problem-solving. Over time, I have built a solid foundation in Python, Java, and
                C, along with expertise in web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p class="second-para">
                I believe that technology is a powerful tool for innovation, and I am constantly seeking
                opportunities to enhance my skills and apply them to real-world problems. My experience includes
                internships at Techmindz and Techmaghi, where I worked on Python programming and data science projects.
                These experiences have sharpened my analytical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and teamwork skills.
                Beyond coding, I have a keen interest in exploring how data-driven technologies can be leveraged for
                smarter decision-making. I also enjoy UI/UX design, using tools like Figma to create user-friendly interfaces.
                My ability to adapt quickly, think critically, and collaborate effectively makes me a valuable asset in
                any tech-driven environment.
            </p>
